# OSRM Background service

For the routing, the agents need a service that informs than how to progress along the road network. The OSRM (Open
Source Routing Machine) provides this service, for driving, cycling and walking. These are actually 3 services, all
derived from a locally stored (in the data folder) OSM pbf file.

## Setting up the OSRM services

Assuming you have installed Docker, proceed as follows.

- From [GeoFabrik](https://www.geofabrik.de/), download the latest OSM file and save it in the `data` folder.
- Update the `preprocess.bat` file to reflect the local GIT folder that you are using, i.e. provide the proper name for
  the `PWD` and `FILE` properties. Run `preprocess.bat`. For The Netherlands, processing all 3 profiles (driving,
  cycling and walking), it takes less than an hour. The first time, it may take slightly more since you also need to
  download the docker images.
